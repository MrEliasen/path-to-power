# Path to Power

Path to Power is an open source [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD), made with NodeJS and React.

It uses (at the time of writing) Twitch.tv as authentication method, but other/more options will be added at a later date.

You can try it out the game on the offical server [here](https://pathtopower.online/)!

**Please Note**: Due to the nature of the content in the game, you must be over 18 to play it.

## Installation

See the README.md for the server and client for more information.
